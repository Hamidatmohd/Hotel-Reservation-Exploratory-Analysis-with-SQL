# Overview

This project explores the booking patterns of hotel customers to gain valuable insights into their behavior when choosing accommodation. These insights can help hotel owners refine their customer strategies and prepare for future trends.

# Data Cleaning
I used Microsoft Excel for data cleaing. I drooped duplicates, replace the null values in the `conutry` column with 'Others'.
I use SQL to create a new column called `People` by merging the `Adults`, `Children` and `Babies` column and i also utilize SQL for exploratory analysis on the data.

# Key Findings & Recommendations

* **City hotel dominance:** While City hotels receive the most bookings, Resort hotels could attract more guests through targeted discounts and promotions.
* **Loyalty potential:** 27.52% of cancellations suggest opportunities for customer retention. Both hotels can introduce loyalty programs or discounts for returning guests.
* **Be ready for breakfast:** BB (Bed and Breakfast) is the preferred meal type. Maintaining sufficient raw materials can prevent breakfast delays.
* **Understand your repeat customers:** With only 3.91% returning guests, a customer survey could reveal reasons for low repeat business.
* **Cater to top travel markets:** Portugal sends the most guests. Enhancing the menu with Portuguese cuisine could increase revenue.
* **Peak season strategies:** August sees the highest booking volume. Implement targeted marketing campaigns for this period.
* **Recognize top performers:** Agent 9 drives the most bookings. Incentivize their continued success with bonuses or recognition programs.
* **Focus on diverse customer types:** While Transient guests dominate, targeted promotions can attract other customer segments.
* **Average occupancy:** Average guest count per booking is 2. This data can inform room type offerings and amenities.
* **Hotel performance insights:** City hotels have longer wait times but higher average daily revenue. GDS channels generate the highest average daily revenue.
* **Seasonal variations:** Peak revenue months differ: May for City hotels and August for Resort hotels. Adjust pricing and promotions accordingly.
* **Reduce cancellations:** Bookings with no deposit are more likely to be canceled. Consider deposit requirements or flexible cancellation policies.

# Conclusion

To attract new customers and retain existing ones, hotels should:

* **Implement attractive offers and packages.**
* **Introduce loyalty programs with valuable rewards.**
* **Provide desirable amenities like parking, kid-friendly spaces, or free Wi-Fi.**

By implementing these recommendations and continuing to analyze customer data, hotels can optimize their strategies and thrive in the competitive hospitality market.
